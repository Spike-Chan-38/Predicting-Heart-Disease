Great observation — this actually tells you **something real and useful** about your data and your modeling setup 👍
Let’s unpack the intuition and then talk about how to *exploit it safely*.

## What it means when more CV folds → higher ROC-AUC

When increasing the number of cross-validation folds (say 5 → 10) improves your **submission AUC**, it usually suggests a combination of these things:

### 1. **Your dataset is relatively small**

* With more folds:

  * Each model is trained on **more data** (e.g. 90% instead of 80%)
  * Logistic regression (especially with L2) benefits a lot from extra data
* The model learns **more stable coefficients**, which improves ranking → higher AUC

**Strong signal:**

> You’re data-limited, not model-limited.

---

### 2. **The signal is weak but consistent**

* AUC is about **ranking**, not exact predictions
* More folds reduce variance in the estimated coefficients
* This stabilizes predicted probabilities, which helps ROC-AUC

If the signal were very strong, fold count wouldn’t matter much.

---

### 3. **Your hyperparameter tuning is variance-sensitive**

* With fewer folds:

  * Your chosen `C` might be **overfitting to one split**
* More folds:

  * Better estimate of the *true* best regularization strength
  * Less noisy hyperparameter selection

This is especially important for **regularized linear models**.

---

### 4. **Class imbalance is likely present**

* In imbalanced datasets:

  * Small validation splits can give unstable AUC estimates
* More folds:

  * Each validation fold better reflects the true class distribution
  * AUC becomes more reliable

This is very common in medical datasets like *Heart Disease*.

---

## What this tells you about the dataset

Putting it together, your dataset is likely:

✔ Small to medium sized
✔ Noisy but with real signal
✔ Possibly imbalanced
✔ Sensitive to regularization strength
✔ Well-suited to linear models with careful tuning

This is *exactly* the kind of dataset where:

> **Careful CV strategy beats fancy models**

---

## How to use this to your advantage (important part)

### 1. **Use more folds for hyperparameter tuning**

If compute allows it:

```python
GridSearchCV(cv=10, scoring="roc_auc")
```

This gives:

* Better `C`
* More stable probability estimates
* Higher leaderboard AUC

---

### 2. **Train the final model on *all* available data**

Once you’ve selected `C`:

* Refit the model on **100% of the training data**
* This almost always improves submission AUC

This is crucial.

---

### 3. **Consider repeated CV**

For extra stability:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold

cv = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=3)
```

This reduces variance even further — great for leaderboard optimization.

---

### 4. **Focus on probability quality, not accuracy**

You already noticed this, but it’s worth stating clearly:

* Accuracy can go down
* ROC-AUC can go up
* **Submission score improves**

That’s exactly what you want.

---

### 5. **Don’t over-interpret leaderboard gains**

One caution ⚠️
If your CV folds start to resemble the test distribution *too closely*, you can accidentally tune to noise.

Rule of thumb:

* CV AUC ↑
* Public leaderboard ↑
* Private leaderboard stable → you’re doing it right

---

## One-sentence intuition (the takeaway)

> Increasing CV folds helps because your dataset is small and noisy, and using more data per model stabilizes probability estimates — which directly improves ROC-AUC.

If you want, I can also show you:

* how to **estimate variance of AUC across folds**, or
* how to **detect if you’re starting to overfit the leaderboard**, or
* how to **stack multiple CV-trained logistic models** for a free AUC boost

Just tell me what direction you want to go 🚀
